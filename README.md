# Mobile Customer Service

## About
This RESTful Web Service keeps track of Customers, and their Mobile Subscriptions.

## Explanation
This is a generic demonstration system developed in Spring Boot, which exposes a simple API for managing Customers and their Mobile Subscriptions in a Database.

```plantuml
!include <c4/C4_Container.puml>

Person(user, "User", "User of the system")
System_Boundary(mobilecustomer_system, "Mobile Customer") {
    Container(mobilecustomer, "Mobile Customer Application", "Java/Spring Boot", "The API Service which users interact with")
    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "The data store")

    Rel_Right(mobilecustomer, database, "uses", "JDBC")
}

Rel(user, mobilecustomer, "uses", "HTTP")
```

## How to use

### Startup
The system is provided as Docker/OCI container images, ready for deployment.  A docker-compose file is provided for convenience.

Use the following command to start a local instance.

```sh
# docker-compose up
```

### Authenticate

The API is protected by a OAuth2 Bearer token.  Before using the various API endpoints a `TOKEN` must be acquired from the `/token` endpoint provided by the service.

> **WARNING**
> This method of token generation is for demonstration purposes only.  A proper service should make use of a standard OIDC Authorization Server to manage users/roles/token generation.
>
> The username and password is also hardcoded into the application, again for demonstration purposes only!

```sh
# export TOKEN=`curl -u user:password http://localhost:8080/token`
```

### Explore the API

Now the various API calls can be called.  The service exposes the API documentation on http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.  A local copy has also been saved into the `openapi3.json` file in this repo.

This file can be uploaded to a service like https://redocly.github.io/redoc/ to get a better view, or imported to a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to work with it.

## The details

### Application internal structure

This application consists of the following components which handle the logic in the application.

```plantuml
!include <c4/C4_Component.puml>

Person(user, "User", "User of the system")
Container_Boundary(application, "Mobile Customer Application") {
    Component(tokencontrol, "Token Controller", "Spring Web", "Handles the OAuth token generation")
    Component(mobilecustomer, "Mobile Customer Controller", "Spring Web", "Exposes the main API of the system")
    Component(mobcustservice, "Mobile Customer Service", "Java", "Main business logic handled here")
    Component(customerrepo, "Customer Repository", "JPA", "Read/Write Customer Entities")
    Component(subscriberrepo, "Mobile Subscriber Repository", "JPA", "Read/Write Mobile Subscription Entities")

    Rel(mobilecustomer, mobcustservice, "uses")
    Rel(mobcustservice, customerrepo, "read/write entities")
    Rel(mobcustservice, subscriberrepo, "read/write entities")

}
ContainerDb(database, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "The data store")
Rel(customerrepo, database, "JDBC/SQL")
Rel(subscriberrepo, database, "JDBC/SQL")

Rel(user, tokencontrol, "Authenticate")
Rel(user, mobilecustomer, "Interact via API")

```
